    "The historical development of quantum mechanics is filled with agitated discussions about the true nature of reality and the extent to which quantum mechanics can explain it. Given the spectacular empirical success of quantum mechanics, it was going to be clear that people would not simply give it up just because some of its aspects were hard to reconcile with intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the root of these different points of views was the question of the nature of measurement. We know there is an element of randomness in quantum measurements, but is that really so? Is there a sneaky way by which the Universe has already decided beforehand which value a given measurement is going to yield at a future time? This hypothesis was the basis for different _hidden variable_ theories. But these theories did not only need to explain randomness at the single particle level. They also needed to explain what happens when different observers measure different parts of a multi-partite entangled system! This went beyond just hidden variable theories. Now a local hidden variable theory was needed in order to reconcile the observations of quantum mechanics with a Universe in which local reality was valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is local reality? In an Universe where locality holds, it should be possible to separate two systems so far in space that they could not interact with each other. The concept of reality is related to whether a measurable quantity holds a particular value _in the absence of any future measurement_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1963, John Stewart Bell published what could be argued as one of the most profound discoveries in the history of science. Bell stated that any theory invoking local hidden variables could be experimentally ruled out. In this section we are going to see how, and we will run a real experiment that demonstrates so!

    "Imagine Alice and Bob are given each one part of a bipartite entangled system. Each of them then performs two measurements on their part of two different operators. Let's call Alice's operators _A_ and _a_ and Bob's: operator _B_ and _b_. What is the expectation value of the quantity $\\langle CHSH \\rangle = \\langle AB \\rangle - \\langle Ab \\rangle + \\langle aB \\rangle + \\langle ab \\rangle = \\langle A(B-b) + a(B+b) \\rangle$ ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Alice and Bob have one qubit each, so any measurement they perform on their system (qubit) can only yield one of two possible outcomes: +1 or -1. Note that whereas we typically refer to the two qubit states as $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, these are *eigenstates*, and a projective measurement will yield their *eigenvalues*, +1 and -1, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if any measurement of _A_, _a_, _B_, and _b_ can only yield $\\pm 1$, the quantities $(B-b)$ and $(B+b)$ can only take on the values 0 or $\\pm2$. And thus, the quantity $A(B-b) + a(B+b)$ can only result in either +2 or -2. This means that there should be a bound for the expectation value of the quantity $|\\langle CHSH \\rangle| = |\\langle AB \\rangle - \\langle Ab \\rangle + \\langle aB \\rangle + \\langle ab \\rangle| \\leq 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the above discussion is oversimplified, because we could consider that the outcome on any set of measurements from Alice and Bob could depend on a set of local hidden variables, but it can be shown with some math that, even when that is the case, the expectation value of the quantity $CHSH$ should be bounded by 2 if local realism held.\n",

However, there are a number of loopholes that have to be closed when violating the inequality in order to claim that either locality or realism have been disproven. These are the detection loophole (where our detector is faulty and fails to provide meaningful statistics) and the locality/causality loophole (where the two parts of the entangled system are separated by a distance smaller than the distance covered by the light in the time it takes to perform a measurement). Given we can generate entangled pairs with high fidelity and every measurement yields a result (this is, no measured particle is \"lost\"), we have closed the detection loophole in our experiments above. However, given the distance between our qubits (a few mm) and the time it takes to perform a measurement (order of $\\mu$s), we cannot claim we closed the causality loophole."
