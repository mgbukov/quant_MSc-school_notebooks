    "# Quantum error correction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical background\n",
    "\n",
    "Error correction has been a well developed field in classical computer science for decades. Classical error correction codes have been used by NASA since its Voyager missions [1] but they also undern modern communication technologies such as 4G.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical information processing, the use of error correction is most important for high-performance communication and high-security applications. Quantum information on the other hand is inherently more fragile than its classical counterpart, which makes error correction indispensible for any large scale application of quantum computing such as Shor's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that, as will become clear in this exercise, quantum error correction is also qualitatively different from classical error correction because the set of errors that can occur are continous. In fact, for a long time it was not known if quntum error correction is possible at all but in 1995, Shor released another landmark paper: a scheme that shared quantum information over multiple qubits in order to reduce errors.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of progress has been made over the decades since. New forms of quantum error correcting codes have been discovered, and a large theoretical framework has been built around them. The surface codes proposed by Kitaev in 1997 have emerged as the leading candidate, and many variations on the original design have emerged since then. But there is still a lot of progress to make in tailoring codes to the specific details of quantum hardware.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll consider a case in which artificial 'errors' are inserted into a circuit. Your task is to design the circuit such that these additional gates can be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then need to think about how to implement your circuit on a real device. This means you'll need to tailor your solution to the layout of the qubits. Your solution will be scored on how few entangling gates (the noisiest type of gate) that you use.\n",

    "## The problem of errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors occur when some spurious operation acts on our qubits. Their effects cause things to go wrong in our circuits. The strange results you may have seen when running on real devices is all due to these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The classical repitition code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by considering a bit of classical information `b`. Since a classical bit can only be `0` or `1`, the only kind of error that can occur is that the bit flips with propability $p$. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "0 \\to \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0~\\text{with propability}~(1-p) \\\\\n",
    "1~\\text{with propability}~p\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The simplest way to do classical error correction is what we all do intuitively: if your friend does not understand what you said at a bar, you repeat it; this is called the *repitition code*. Formally it means that we *encode* the two possible values `0` and `1` into *codewords*\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar 0 = 000\\\\\n",
    "\\bar 1 = 111\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The resulting bit $\\bar b$ is called a *logical bit*. Now, if a single error occurs on out logical bit, we can correct it by what is called *majority voting*: we just reset the state of $\\bar b$ to either $\\bar 0$ or $\\bar 1$ if there are more 0s or 1s in $\\bar b$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How about the quantum version?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does quantum error correction differ from its classical counterpart? The main difference stems from the difference between classical and quantum information. A qubit is a state $|\\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$ that, as you well know is parametrized by three continuous parameters. This also mean that the most general *error* that can occur on a single qubit is given by a hermitian $2\\times 2$ matrix \n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = a I + b X + c XZ + d Z,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "From the above decomposition, we can see that compared to the classical case we do not only get bitflip errors $X$ but also *phase-flip* errors $Z$ (or both, that is $XZ = -iY$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we apply this matrix to some single qubit state $|\\psi\\rangle$ we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M |\\psi\\rangle = a|\\psi\\rangle + b X |\\psi\\rangle + c XZ |\\psi\\rangle + d Z |\\psi\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting superposition is composed of the original state, the state we'd have if the error was just a bit flip, the state for just a phase flip and the state for both. This situation seems much more complicated than than the classical version! \n",
    "What makes quantum error correction a feasible task is that we can __measure__. If we devise a way to measure whether a bit or phase flip happened, the state collapses to one of the possbilities\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M |\\psi\\rangle \\to\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\phantom{XZ}|\\psi\\rangle &\\text{with propability}~|a|^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\phantom{Z}X|\\psi\\rangle &\\text{with propability}~|b|^2 \\\\\n",
    "XZ|\\psi\\rangle &\\text{with propability}~|c|^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\phantom{X}Z|\\psi\\rangle &\\text{with propability}~|d|^2\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and we can correct the quantum error deterministically. \n",
    "\n",
    "It runs our we can devise such measurement schemes and these are what we call quantum error correction codes. In this exercise we will try to get an intution about how this works. Most of the exercise whill be concerened with implementing a working *bit-flip* code on a quantum computer, but as you will (hopefully) see in the very end, the generalization to both phase- and bit-flips is not that hard!"
